# To-Do List App

This repository contains the source code for a simple To-Do List application built using React. This application allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, and deleting them. It also provides the functionality to mark tasks as completed.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list by entering a task description and clicking the "Save" button.
- **Edit Tasks**: Tasks can be edited by clicking the edit button next to each task, modifying the task description, and saving the changes.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks by clicking the delete button next to each task. A confirmation dialog is displayed before deleting the task.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed by checking the checkbox next to each task. Completed tasks are visually distinguished with a strikethrough effect.
- **Show/Hide Completed Tasks**: Users have the option to show or hide completed tasks using a checkbox.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
